# Sort-Comparisons
A simple program to compare the efficiency of various sorting algorithms.

This simple program has a few settings with various values that are used to create a list of numbers to be sorted. You can then choose from several different sorting algorithms to see which is the most efficient. The list to be sorted can start off In Order, Reverse Order, Almost in Order, or Random Order. There are also several different sizes of initial lists. You can start with 5,000, 15,000 or 50,000 items. 
You can then sort the list using Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, or Radix Sort.
This program interacts with the user through the command line, and prints all output to the command line. The output will tell you the initial list settings, the sort choosen, the amount of comparisons, the number of swaps, and the total time.
